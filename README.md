# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with AI

---

## Overview

This project aims to develop an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. The primary goal is to create a robust system capable of identifying and responding to various network attacks and anomalies in real-time or near real-time.

This project will serve as a practical learning experience for members of [Your College Club Name] at [Your College Name], covering fundamental concepts in cybersecurity, network programming, and machine learning.

## Core Concepts

Students working on this project will explore and implement the following key areas:

* **Network Packet Analysis:** Understanding how network traffic is structured and how to capture and inspect individual data packets.
* **Feature Engineering:** Identifying relevant characteristics from network packets that can distinguish between normal and malicious activity.
* **Machine Learning for Security:** Applying various AI algorithms (e.g., classification, anomaly detection) to detect known attack patterns and identify new, unseen threats.
* **System Integration:** Combining different modules (packet capture, data processing, AI model, alerting) into a functional IDS.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, participants will have:

* A deeper understanding of network security principles and common attack types.
* Hands-on experience with network programming in Python.
* Practical skills in applying machine learning techniques to real-world security challenges.
* A functional prototype of an AI-powered IDS.

## Technologies (To be explored and chosen)

Students will have the opportunity to explore and select technologies, but common choices for this type of project include:

* **Programming Language:** Python (due to its rich libraries for networking and AI)
* **Network Packet Libraries:** `scapy`, `pyshark`
* **Machine Learning Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`/`keras`
* **Data Handling:** `pandas`, `numpy`

## Getting Started (Initial Steps)

1.  **Understand the Basics:** Research core concepts of IDSs, network protocols (TCP/IP), and basic machine learning algorithms.
2.  **Set up Development Environment:** Install Python and essential libraries.
3.  **Explore Packet Capture:** Experiment with `scapy` or `pyshark` to capture and interpret local network traffic.
4.  **Data Exploration:** Begin researching public IDS datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) to understand typical data formats for training AI models.
